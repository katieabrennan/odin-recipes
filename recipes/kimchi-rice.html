        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kimchi is king. If cooking veggie, check your kimchi to make sure it doesn't contain shrimp. Go bold, the more potent the kimchi - the better the rice.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pak choi</li>
            <li>25ml sesame oil</li>
            <li>215g kimchi</li>
            <li>500g microwave rice</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
            <li>50g coriander</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the pak choi, keeping the white stalks and leaves separate, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Get a large frying pan or wok over a high heat. Drizzle in some sesame oil and use a fork to add the kimchi straight from the jar, (saving the juice for later) and the white pak choi stalks. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then tip in the pouches of rice. Use the back of your spoon to break up the rice grains and give everything a good stir. Turn down the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Get a second large frying pan over a high heat and drizzle in
                a good glug of sesame oil. Crack in the eggs. Once the whites begin to set, sprinkle over the sesame seeds and chilli flakes, then use a spoon to baste the egg whites with the sesame oil until they begin to crisp. Turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Back to the rice. Turn the heat back up and then stir through a large splash of kimchi juice and the pak choi leaves. Tear in most of the coriander leaves. Cook for a further minute.</li>
            <li>Divide the kimchi fried rice between four bowls. Top each portion with a sesame and chilli fried egg and tear over the remaining coriander leaves to serve.</li>
        </ol>
