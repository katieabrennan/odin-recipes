        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This creamy, cosy vegan butter bean bowl is filling and delicious and comes together in just 10 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>470g drained butterbeans (and reserved liquid)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegan cream cheese</li>
            <li>300g cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>70g spinach</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>chilli flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely slice the garlic. Heat a pot or deep saucepan over medium-low heat with a drizzle of olive. Stir fry the garlic for a few minutes until just starting to become fragrant and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the butter beans with their liquid into the pot and then add the tomatoes. Reduce the heat to low. Stir for a few minutes until the tomatoes are starting to soften. Squash the tomatoes with the back of a spoon so that they release their juices. Stir through the spinach.</li>
            <li>Add the vegan cream cheese and stir to create a creamy sauce with the tomato juice and butterbean liquid.</li>
            <li>When the spinach has wilted, season well and taste. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and some chilli flakes if using. Serve with crusty bread or with rice.</li>
        </ol>
