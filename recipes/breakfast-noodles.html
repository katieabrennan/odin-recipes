        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Picture a fry-up on top of a bowl of instant noodles, and you'll get an idea of what this is all about. A cup of tea is optional, but highly recommended.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 tomato</li>
            <li>1 spring onion</li>
            <li>100g instant noodles</li>
            <li>4 rashers streaky bacon</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Thinly slice your mushrooms, chop your tomato in half and thinly slice your spring onion.</li>
            <li>Cook your noodles according to packet instructions. Add the seasonings from the packet and soy sauce. Give it a good mix.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fry your bacon until crispy then set aside. Now, fry up your egg with the tomato and mushrooms in the same pan and set them aside, too.</li>
            <li>Pour the noodles into your favourite bowl with the tomato, egg, bacon, mushrooms and spring onion. Tuck in.</li>
